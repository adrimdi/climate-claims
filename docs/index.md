### Summary of Claims 
* There is no current climate emergency because global temperature data has been misleading 
* The graph used by NASA to show rapid increasing temperature trend is intentionally misleading 
* By using absolute temperature values the temperture trend is much less steep and not as scary as the media presents

This article seeks to discredit that the increase in temperature measured by NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) does not warrant the title of a climate emergency. The article explains that the graph widely used to represent this rapid temperature increase is misleading because it zones in on a narrow range of temperatures and sets the axis to magnify the trend. The article also shows that if you take the absolute temperature instead of accounting for anomalies it makes the trend appear much less threatening than the one widely distributed. Also brought up is a registered letter that was sent to the United Nations secretary general backed up by 500 scientists stating that there is no climate emergency. This argument is of particular interest because of how generally accepted it is that there is a significant increase in global temperatures due to anthropogenic activities and how this is dangerous. This is something that is taught even in early school years so if the whole idea is misconstrued it would be a big deal. 

In assessing this article one of the first things that stand out is there is no author associated with it and it is just a product of the site “Everything Climate”.  There is no way to know how informed the person/people writing this article are in this field. This is especially important because the article shows a figure produced from data that they altered from GISS. In their original calculations GISS accounted for anomalies which the article claims exaggerates the increasing temperature trend dramatically. The articles claims that they remove the anomaly calculation using the agreed upon baseline temperature and provides a link to a webpage on GISS surface analysis. When visiting that actual webpage, we find that the GISS states that in most cases the absolute temperatures are unnecessary. The quotation used in the article leaves out the second part of the sentence “For the global mean, the most trusted models produce a value of roughly 14°C, i.e. 57.2°F, but it may easily be anywhere between 56 and 58°F and regionally, let alone locally, the situation is even worse” (GISS, 2021). This contradicts the article stating that the baseline they use is generally agreed upon because this shows it is a rough estimate and not widely used. This makes the reasoning for why the article deemed it necessary to use absolute temperature questionable. Additionally, their figure does show an increasing trend in temperature, though much less alarming it is still present. 

In terms of their claims against the climate emergency, the article does not have any citations backing their claims up. All they have done is create their own figure based of GISS data and explained how graphs can sometimes be misleading by citing a source there. Otherwise there is no external sources supporting their claims. The letter signed by 500 scientists and professional does in fact exist, however, the majority are not climate scientists or even in science at all, instead specializing in economics and other fields. Given the extremely vast field of climate science alone never mind the rest of these disciplines only 500 signatures does not seem very significant or a strong point for their argument. 
Overall, while the statement that data being presented is misleading should cause any critical thinker to pause, the argument presented in this article does not hold up to being very credible. The site itself dedicates itself to debunking climate change claims so there is a strong chance of bias in their writings. They use GISS data to create their own figures using a method that is not widely considered needed nor is it backed up by any other sources that what they produced is credible. And finally, they state that 500 scientist and professionals say there is no climate emergency but this pales in comparison to the many more scientist who do agree that there is a big problem.
